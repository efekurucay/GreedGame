Dear Students,
Some of you were concerned about the uncertainty in the grading of PA1, they said we cannot be sure what will be the highest score so we can never know whether what we did is enough at the time of submission. This is indeed a valid concern. So here is the deal. With a 1-2 hours of casual effort (most of it contains waiting for results and fixing the timeout problem), I was able to get a result around 40% (with just around 50 lines of code in the whole Player class) and I'm sure I could improve it if I had more time at least another 10%. So, I'll fix the grading according to 50%. So, 50% gets full credit. Since the starter codes achieve around 20% already, we will scale your grade between these. So above 50% will get full credit. Below 20% will get 0. Between 20% and 50%, your grade will be = (avgpercentage-20)*10/3. For example, if you achieve 38%, your grade will be (38-20)*10/3=60.
 
(Don't worry, if some boards are stuck from the beginning I'll re-run - until my current code achieves 40%.)
 
Here are my own results averaging to  40.12% with 10 games per board size.
